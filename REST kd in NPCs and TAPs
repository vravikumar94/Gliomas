marked increase in HCN cells grown in iQNP conditions in  REST sh-EGFP electroporated cells  expressing Ki67 and incorporated BrdU relative to control EGFP electroporated cells.
REST knockdown decreased percentage of cells in G0-G1 phase, and increased fraction of cells in S-phase.
Cells in TAP conditions - REST kd --> decrease in cells that incorporated BrdU and expressed Ki67 relative to control.
decreased percentage of cells in S-phase, incresed cells in G0/G1 phase.

REST is required to maintain both quiscent and proliferation states to prevent premature differentiation into neurons. 
identification of REST target genes in HCN cells expected to define new REST targets important in regulating adult NSC pool.
